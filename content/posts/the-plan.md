The overall plan is to make money online in order to do less hours at work and also be able to buy a house and spend more time travelling with family. In order to make this money, I need to have a solid strategy of diversified income streams that will suppliment my wages until I have a healthy amount of savings.

## Income Streams

In the past I have tried a lot of different forms of making money online. I've tried dropshipping, I've tried bulk buying items from China to sell, I've tried affiliate websites, I've tried print-on-demand, I've tried domain flipping. Basically if theres a way to make money online I've most likely tried it and given up far too quickly to ever actually make any real money. 

After trying all of these things, some at the same time as other, I have learnt that to get started I need to pick one main thing and stick with that until it makes money. I've also decided I need an income stream that doesn't cost money initially, so then when that makes money I can use that to start another income stream, so on and so forth.

That way I'm never spending my own money, which I have little disposable income due to debt, to fund these ventures.

## The First Income Stream(s)

The key is to getting started is to pick the right thing that doesn't cost money. In that case, I think **Youtube or YouTube Automation** could be a good choice. I can do it all without having to pay anyone and my channel is almost at monetisation requirements so it should start earning money soon.

There are a few other options to make free income, I have a **TikTok account with over 10,000 followers** which needs **100k views in 30 days** to be eligible for monetisation, which could be fairly easy if posting consistently. It doesn't pay as much as YouTube but if I'm posting YouTube Shorts I could reuse that content for TikTok.

I also own domains which I bought when expired that have a constant amount of traffic. I made **blogger websites** and have filled those websites with content in order to try and get monetised with **Google Adsense**. This is a tedius task because getting approved on Google Adsense isn't that easy anymore and website now need a lot of content, plus the time for reviews take weeks instead of days like it used to. If I have a few of these websites monetised it could fund another venture.

My other option which isn't free but very cheap is to use **ChatGPT** to help me make **online games** and then use **TikTok virality** to advertise those games. I already made a [Transfer Rumour Generator](https://transferrumourgenerator.online/) with ChatGPT that does get traffic. Depending on the amount of traffic these games/websites get could alter the way I try to monetise them. Domain names are very cheap on [NameCheap](http://namecheap.com) and depending on the complexity of the website I can host them for free on Github Pages. 

## Then What

I know I said I would pick one thing to start with and I've described 4 things I could do but they are similar in nature and don't require that much work if I was to combine them. The question is, when one of them starts producing an income, what then?

Obviously it will take a lot of time for any of these to make any substantial amount of money so I would need to use the money they do generate wisely. I've always enjoyed **niche affiliate websites** in the past so this could be an option once I can cover the hosting fee. Once I have money for advertising I would also consider **dropshipping** again but using **TikTok ads for promotion**. I could also scale up any of the existing ways of making money, **put money into YouTube/Tiktok, buy more expired domains, try and create mobile apps with ChatGPT and sell them.**

So anyway, thats the plan. I'll probably come back to this post in a years time and do an update and see if I actually made any money or not. ✌️
